                <source>1) This folder is displayed when at least one of the checkboxes field in the folder &quot;Checkboxes and radio&quot; is checked.
Please take a look at edit View configuration in the SAV Library Kickstarter to see how a folder can be dynamically changed.
            
2) This folder illustrates how views can be dynamically changed based on the value of a field.
            
Select a view then click on the &quot;save and show&quot; button or save and then click on the show button. 

The displayed view depends on the value of the radio button. Please take a look at the SAV Library Kickstarter.
- Two new views, &quot;View 1&quot; and &quot;View 2&quot;, have been added. 
- Conditional views with condition fields have also been added to the form &quot;Test&quot;.

3) This folder illustrates also the use of localization tags, i.e. $$$label$$$ tags. 
The labels are defined in the language file of this extension (Resources/Private/Language).

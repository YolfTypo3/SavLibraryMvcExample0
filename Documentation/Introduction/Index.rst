This extension was created with the `SAV Library Kickstarter 
<https://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/sav_library_kickstarter>`_ in
order to be used with the `SAV Library Mvc
<https://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/sav_library_mvc>`_
extension.

The SAV Library Extension Kickstarter makes it possible to directly
build extensions  **without any PHP coding**, thanks to simple
configuration parameters.

The SAV Library Kickstarter includes:

- Creation of multiple views of the data,

- Front end input of the data,

- Views with folders,

- Context Sensitive Help,

- Generation of emails,

- Generation of RTF files using database tags,

- Data export in CSV format,

- Many other features.

This example is a test extension which illustrates several features of the 
SAV Library Mvc extension.
